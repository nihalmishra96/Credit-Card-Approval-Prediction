# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction

## Problem Statement

### The improvement of the credit scoring system in the financial sector is the use-case for this machine learning application. Conventional credit score cards assess the likelihood of future defaults and credit card borrowings using previous data and regression models. Unfortunately, previous models may lose their forecasting ability during economic downturns, resulting in erroneous credit scores.
Finding a model that can deliver credit scoring with both accuracy and transparency is the aim of this machine learning use case. By guaranteeing that credit judgments are reasonable, impartial, and trustworthy, this will enhance the whole decision-making process in the financial sector. Financial Institutions can make better decisions about who to grant credit card to and be able to effectively communicate those decisions to clients by utilizing machine learning to assess a larger range of data inputs and produce more accurate credit scores. In the end, this will ensure that clients are treated fairly and that lenders can better manage their credit risks
